# EcoScanner - Sustainability Scanner App

A Flutter application built for a hackathon that analyzes food packaging labels to provide sustainability scores and flag potentially harmful ingredients.

## üöÄ About The Project

This app allows users to take a picture of a food product's ingredients list. The image is processed by an OCR service, and the extracted text is then sent to the Gemini API for a detailed analysis. The frontend, built with Flutter, presents this analysis in a beautiful and easy-to-understand format.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Image-to-Text:** Uses an OCR API to extract ingredients from an image.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverages the Gemini API to analyze ingredients for sustainability and health impacts.
- **Eco-Grading System:** Assigns an overall sustainability grade (A-E) to the product.
- **Red Flag System:** Highlights potentially harmful or unsustainable ingredients.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, animated, and responsive user interface built with Flutter.
